# Very first steps using Ionic Health to detect user Activity

It's just that... A simple project to demonstrate the use of Ionic Health.

### Installing

Open a command line console and clone this project.

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/IonicHealth
```

Go to the new created directory

```
cd IonicHealth
```

Test the project

```
ionic serve --lab
```

When all node.js modules have been downloaded a new browser window will open with the project shown above in the screenshots.


To create this test project I have followed the instructions of this link:
https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/health/

Don't forget to read this:
https://github.com/dariosalvi78/cordova-plugin-health

After that clone this project and try it.

The Database is here:

It's interesting that you take the cookies into account when testing the Basic Auth with Postman:

### A Basic, basic, basic version with hard coded users

For such a version of this project use git to checkout the second commit called: 

==> Auth Basic: a bit more complex, https://github.com/tcrurav/SpringCrudBasicAuthRestJPAMySQL/tree/c5ac1f247d51679254c8297a0e459d67287878b7

All you need is... 
* An editor. I have used Visual Studio Code. Other options are Sublime Text, Atom, etc...
